## Welcome 
My name is Martin Salak. I am a PhD student at Faculty of Civil Engineering at Czech Technical University in Prague. I give half of my working time to school and half to a job and I enjoy both.


## Me
_I am a structural engineer who would like to contribute to the development of our way of working. I enjoy structural enginneering - from working with cement with my own hands to coding in Python_

Growing up in Prague I had lot of beatuiful architecture around me which I loved, but I found out that not only the old buidling interest me. I also wanted to see the Chrisler Building in New York and Forth Bridge in Scotland. This led me to Structural Engineering which I am happy I chose.

At university I was lucky to do my yearly projects under the group lead by professor Stemberk, where students are granted lot of freedom. This helped me to find projects which helped me to learn as well as have fun while doing it. For my master thesis I created a concrete model of a bridge, described [here](./Masters.md). In 2020 I started my PhD studuies under supervision of prof. Stemberk, for more information what I am working on you cana have a look on [PhD](./PhD.md) page.

While studying I worked as a junior structural engineer for two years. Then, in 2021 I started in SCIA as Functuional Analyst helping developing software for structural Engineers.

In my personal life I like to hike and generally be in nature. This passion comes from my boyscout years. I started as a kid and until recently I helped to lead the group. Now I only visit the summer camp deep in the forest. I like sports, namely volleyball, fotball and skiing and I am a keen Magic the Gathering player. But the majority of my personal time I spend with my family.
